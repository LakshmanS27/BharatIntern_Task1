Description:

The SMS Classifier for Spam Detection is a data science project designed to develop a robust and efficient system for automatically categorizing Short Message Service (SMS) messages as either spam or legitimate. With the increasing prevalence of unsolicited messages, this project aims to enhance user experience by filtering out unwanted and potentially harmful content.

Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to create a machine learning model capable of accurately distinguishing between spam and non-spam SMS messages. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, the system aims to achieve high precision and recall rates, minimizing false positives and false negatives.

Key Components:

Data Collection:
Gather a diverse dataset of labeled SMS messages, including both spam and legitimate messages. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the machine learning model.

Data Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess the SMS data, including tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and removing stop words. This step is crucial for preparing the data in a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

Feature Extraction:
Extract relevant features from the preprocessed SMS messages. Features may include word frequencies, character n-grams, and other linguistic characteristics that can help distinguish between spam and non-spam content.

Model Selection:
Experiment with various machine learning models, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) or Transformer-based models. Evaluate and select the model that provides the best performance on the dataset.

Model Training:
Train the selected model using the labeled dataset. Fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance and generalization ability.

Outcome:
Spam or Ham mail indentification
